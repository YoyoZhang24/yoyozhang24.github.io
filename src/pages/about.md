Hi! I'm Yoyo. Here's a little about me :)

I've been blogging since I was 12. My first blog is in Chinese and hosted on WeChat Publications (if you read Chinese, feel free to go follow <a href="/assets/wechat-blog-qr.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">薄荷味的Mint</a>). After 7 years, I finally decided to start another blog dedicated to English posts for my audiences around the world. 

Writing has always been my passion. I started with documenting my journey moving from the China to the U.S. alone in sixth grade. After boarding school and college, my writings have shifted more towards educational and career-related content. 

I've very grateful for the platform I've built, including both my Chinese- and English-speaking readers, and the <a href="https://www.yzacademy.com/" target="_blank">tutoring business</a> I've been able to launch as a result. I'm always excited to learn more, build more, and connect with brilliant minds. 


## My Journey (so far)

I've lived many lives. I was born and raised in Shanghai, and then moved to Connecticut for junior boarding school (alone!). My family now splits our time between Shanghai and New York City / Southern Connecticut. I go to school in Chicago, but I'm always on the go.

I graduated from <a href="https://www.choate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choate Rosemary Hall</a> in 2024, and I'm currently pursuing a B.A. in Economics and a joint B.A./M.S. in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the University of Chicago</a>. If all goes well, I'll graduate in 2028. 

I love coding, abstract math, and engineering problems. But I'm also drawn to art, literature, film, and beautiful product design (yes, I make *really* good slides). 

I pursued a wide variety of things in high school: researching at [Yale](https://aclanthology.org/people/yoyo-zhang/), founding [TEDxChoate](https://tedx.choate.edu/image-with-title-and-description/), founding [GirlTech Magazine](https://linktr.ee/girltechmag), editing [The Choate News](https://thechoatenews.choate.edu/about) ... Some might be more relevant to my current life than others, but I'm grateful for everything I've learned.
