## Who I Am

Hey, I'm Yoyo Zhang 👋 You may know me as a writer, an entrepreneur, or a content creator. 

I graduated from Choate Rosemary Hall in 2024, and I'm currently pursuing a B.A. in Economics and a joint B.A./M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, expected to graduate in 2028. 

I have experience in 

👉 For professional connections: 

👉 For friends and family: 

I'm also active on X, YouTube, and RedNote (小红书).

## My Journey

I started my first blog at 12 years old (in 2018), and I've been loving it ever since. Back then, I wrote primarily in Chinese, and I hosted my blog on WeChat Publications (微信公众号). I still post actively on there (my account is called 薄荷味的Mint, for the Chinese speakers here), but I decided to start a website for English articles. 

I've always loved writing. When I started blogging in 6th grade, I was just moving from China to the U.S. Writing was a crucial outlet for me during those lonely times, and it's helped me deal with many changes, challenges, and stressful moments.
