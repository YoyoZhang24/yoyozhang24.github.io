Hi, this is Yoyo. Maybe we've met, or maybe we're just internet friends. Either way, welcome to my little universe. 

I've been blogging since 12 years old. My original blog is in Chinese and hosted on WeChat Publications (if you read Chinese, feel free to go follow <a href="/assets/wechat-blog-qr.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">薄荷味的Mint</a>). After 7 years, I finally decided to start another blog dedicated to English posts for my audiences around the world. 

Writing has always been my passion. I started with documenting my journey moving from the China to the U.S. alone in sixth grade. After boarding school and college, my writings have shifted more towards educational and career-related content. 

I've very grateful for the platform I've built, including both my Chinese- and English-speaking readers, and the <a href="https://www.yzacademy.com/" target="_blank">tutoring business</a> I've been able to launch as a result. I'm always excited to learn more, build more, and connect with brilliant minds. 


## My Journey

I've lived many lives. Shanghai is my hometown, but my family and I also spend a lot of our time in a small town in Southern Connecticut. I now go to school in Chicago, and I try to see as much of the world as I can when there's time. 

I graduated from <a href="https://www.choate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choate Rosemary Hall</a> in 2024, and I'm currently pursuing a B.A. in Economics and a joint B.A./M.S. degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the University of Chicago</a>. If all goes well, I'll graduate in 2028. 

I consider myself a technical creator. I love coding, abstract math, and engineering problems. But I'm also drawn to art, literature, film, and beautiful product design (yes, I make *really* good slides). 

In high school, I pursued a wide variety of things: founder of [TEDx](https://tedx.choate.edu/image-with-title-and-description/), founder of [GirlTech Magazine](https://linktr.ee/girltechmag), editor of [school newspaper](https://thechoatenews.choate.edu/about), researcher at [Yale](https://aclanthology.org/people/yoyo-zhang/) ... Some might be more relevant to my current life than others, but I'm grateful for everything I've learned.
