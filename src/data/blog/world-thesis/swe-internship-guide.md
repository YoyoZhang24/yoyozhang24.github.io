This guide is synthesized from my own experience as a SWE intern (8 weeks on-site at an EdTech decacorn, 12 weeks on-site at a CS research lab, and 2 years for various AI startups). I’d also like to thank the UChicago Career Office and all the mentors I’ve met along the way for sharing advice that have proven to be helpful in practice.

# Top Goals

For a summer internship that lasts 2-3 months, you really want to make the most out of each day. Each person might go in with different goals in mind, but I find it helpful to write down a few principles to remind myself every morning I walk into office:

## 1. Learn and grow rapidly
It goes without saying that learning should be the top priority. There have been times where I got sidetracked by trying too hard to make a good impression, or reaching for sky-high goals that are simply impossible in the timeframe. The smartest option is to optimize for self-improvement. 

## 2. Deliver value
Value creation could happen within and beyond the projects you’re assigned. As an intern, it’s expected that you’ll need more handholding, and will probably be spending most of the time learning. Of course you should contribute to the technical projects whenever possible, but don’t ignore other ways to make yourself helpful, including making coffee, taking out the trash, or just being a cheerful presence.

## 3. Build trust and relationships
Eight weeks is enough to make a lasting impression. Take the opportunity to build a strong relationship with your mentors and colleagues. They can be an incredible network later on regardless of whether you plan to stay at the same company. Having worked with you closely, they could provide a professional evaluation of you that is more accurate than most others you know.

# I. Learning Effectively

## Be obsessed with understanding, not just finishing

The best thing you can do at an internship is to ask questions. Most likely you’ll be assigned a mentor, and a project group with other interns and senior members working on assignments. You’re expected to take initiative when it comes to things you don’t understand, whether it’s technical or logistical. Always ask questions when you’re confused. 

The caveat to this is that you should be **prepared** when you ask questions. If you’re given an assignment, read through the instructions, then ask pinpointed questions about the specifics. Do your homework. 

With that, I also recommend keeping a running list of concepts, acronyms, tools, or processed you don’t know. I use Notion, but Google Docs, Notes App, or even a physical notebook will do.

## Write everything down

This goes with the previous advice of taking learning notes, but it also applies to work log. Write down what you accomplished, learned, and stumbled upon.

Some employers might require a daily report, but even if they don’t, all teams definitely have some sort of regular check-ins where you’re expected to showcase your progress. I find it very helpful to keep a to-do list and write down all the tasks I’ve completed and roadblocks I’ve faced, on a daily basis.

For SWE roles specifically, it’s helpful to document your environment setup (steps, commands, processes) in the beginning. This will not only serve as a helpful reference for you but also show initiative. 

## Ask smart questions

Here’s a formula I’ve found helpful for asking technical questions:

> Here’s what I’ve tried [explain previous efforts] ... 

Here’s what I think is happening [summarize roadblock] … 

Can you help me understand [the next steps / how to fix this issue / how to work around this]?
> 

# II. Working Smart

## Start small, deliver early

I struggle with perfectionism **a lot**. 

During my first research internship, I spent three days fixing a small bug in the code before asking my mentor for help. 

I get it. We all want to deliver our best work. But like my dad always reminds me: *“Completion is more important than perfection.”*

We all need to set our “student mindset” aside for a second and stop treating deliverables as our Media Aesthetics final essay that we **need** an A on to save our grade (this is a UChicago reference). 

In a fast-paced work environment, it’s better to deliver something early, even if it’s incomplete, to get feedback quickly. 

## Write clean, readable code

Maybe this is where I play the Devil’s Advocate and say that a healthy dose of perfectionism can help sometimes. It’s fine to slack off on PEP8 or use emojis as variable names in personal projects, but in a professional setting, it’s absolutely necessary to follow the team’s style guide. 

Each team might is different - startups tend to be more scrappy and lax whereas unicorns would have comprehensive databases of guidelines - but regardless, you should hold yourself to the same standards as your senior teammates.

I won’t repeat the lecture that you’ll probably get from your boss, but just ask for code review when possible, learn from the best practices, and take every comment to heart. This is when you elevate yourself as a programmer. 

## Treat every ticket as a chance to learn

Be a sponge.Even trivial tasks (like a UI tweak or config change) are opportunities to learn the stack behind them. 

I’m absolutely obsessed with note-taking and would take notes even on git tutorials. For me, note-taking helps me digest the material and keep track of my progress.

Here is an example of my Notion note collection by the end of an 8-week internship:

Everyone has their own style, though. You don’t need to create dozens of folders. Just take every chance to learn, however works best for you. Start with your current assignment, then explore everything related to it. Pounce on every new concept that comes your way.

This is the fastest way to expand your knowledge and improve the speed at which you absorb information, which will serve you well beyond the summer. 

# III. Building relationships & reputation

## Overcommunicate (without spamming)

My first big SWE internship was with a very chill team that didn’t require all the interns to submit formal reports. We did have opportunities to share our progress (during daily standups or team meetings throughout the week), but it was easy to hide away since no one was explicitly asking about what the interns were up to. 

To keep myself accountable and show my initiative, I made it a rule to send my mentor a written report every evening. Nothing super overboard, just a quick summary of what problems I solved, what problems I faced, and my plan for the next day. 

This was done in addition to the spontaneous chats, Q&A, and meetings throughout the day, so that I could have something concrete. It helped give me a sense of accomplishment and urgency, and it also helped my mentor point me in the right direction or assign me tasks that could maximize productivity. 

Here’s a simple template:

> **1. Today’s Progress:**
> 
> - Quantify main achievements
> - Explain whether everything is going as expected
> - Make note of any obstacles or surprises
> 
> **2. Reflection:**
> 
> - Note main questions, issues, to-dos
> - Include any methods to improve productivity
> - Add any other thoughts
> 
> **3. Goals for tomorrow**
> 
> - Quantify
> - Qualify

## Be coachable

Some very talented young programmers can be defensive when receiving feedback. It’s natural to feel protective of your work, especially when you’ve poured hours into it, but in a professional setting, feedback is not personal. It’s not gold.

One thing I love about being an intern is that I’m expected to make mistakes. That makes it easier to accept feedback, implement it, and move on.

I actively *invite* feedback. When someone points out something to improve, you should take notes, summarize what you understood, and follow up once you’ve applied it. Even a quick response like:

> “Thanks for pointing that out. I’ve updated the code with your suggestions. Let me know if you’d like me to tweak it further!”
> 

goes a long way.

The best people to work with aren’t necessarily the smartest, but the ones that are open, humble, and adaptable. Be that person.

## Make your mentor’s life easier

There were definitely times during internships where I questioned whether I was adding any value to the team, or even felt like I was being a burden to my mentor, who already had their own workload to handle on top of “parenting” me. 

I think this is completely normal and expected. When you’re doing your best to learn the skills and make progress here and there, it’s best to make your mentor’s life as easy as possible. 

Respect their time by being prepared, documenting your questions, and not staying stuck in silence for hours. If you’re blocked for more than 30-60 minutes, ask for help. 

Even small gestures, like offering to take notes in meetings, keeping the workspace organized, volunteering to test someone else’s code, show that you’re proactive and invested in the team’s success, not just your own.

Your mentor will remember that you made their summer less stressful, and that’s one of the best reputations you can leave behind.

# On the Last Week

Ask for feedback explicitly:

> What is one thing I can improve before the internship ends?
> 

Try to demo your work and make sure your contributions are visible.

If you follow this guide and stay humble, curious, and consistent, I can promise that your experience will at least match your expectation, if not exceed it.
